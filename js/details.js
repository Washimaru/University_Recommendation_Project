   UniMatch — DETAIL DATA LAYER
   window.UM.details.get(u)  ->  full 10-category profile for a school.

   Strategy (hybrid):
     • estimate(u)  — derives every category from the school's structured
       profile (admit GPA, size, type, strengths, vibe vectors). All such
       figures are clearly labelled "est." in the UI.
     • FACTS[name]  — hand-curated REAL data for ~60 most-searched schools,
       deep-merged over the estimate. These get a "Verified facts" badge.

   The 10 categories requested:
     1 admissions (GPA, SAT/ACT, acceptance)   6 research
     2 class size / student:faculty ratio       7 professional-school placement
     3 known-for schools / majors               8 Greek life
     4 special programs / collaborations        9 athletics
     5 scholarships & aid                       10 outcomes / employers
